# Black-Excellence
# A Photography design concept created by me
@Author~ Michael Mabinuola
I love photography and enjoy taking pictures at my free time so I decided to build a photography portfolio website. 

This website makes use of heave GSAP animation. 
It is a responsive photography website prototype built using CSS grid system, HTML, SVG, and JavaScript.

It was designed with black and white.
